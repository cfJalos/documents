# Information for Volunteer Developers

Our volunteer program is very flexible and tailored to what you are able to contribute. The purpose of our program is not only to help us make the logistics of getting food to families more efficient but also to help give new technologists such as software engineers practical experience working on a business product and with a team.

Because of this flexible nature, this document has been written to be a guide for mentors and volunteers to formalize our process and learning for our volunteers.
